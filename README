This project can be run as it is. It uses the files included in the zip file.

Please ensure that your web browser accepts popups as the website will need to create a pop up for the email function used.

I used these resources: 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7381150/how-to-send-an-email-from-javascript
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10219781/javascript-adding-linebreak-in-mailto-body/10220953

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/901115/how-can-i-get-query-string-values-in-javascript

as well as a lot more of the bootstrap documentation for grids, themes, html_form_input_types

In order to walk through this website and see all the requirements I had in my project requirements (Part 1) assignment,
please start at index.html.
Travel to the different pages in the navbar in order to see how they look.

After looking at the home page and the pages in the navbar, you can begin the application from many places:
index.html, workingCapital.html, equipmentFin.html 

all have links or buttons to reach the application page.

From the application page you will find a form. Please fill out the form as needed, just the required fields are necessary.

Upon hitting submit, it should direct u to the confirmation page (if you filled the required forms)
AND your browser may ask to open a pop up of some sort. Click yes or agree because my website will try to send an email using the default email application.
The content of this email should be from the form.

The confirmation page shall also display the contents of the form.

That would be the end of the tour. Thank you for looking through it.
